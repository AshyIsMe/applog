#applog
Tracking what apps you use all day every day!
This is intended to be something similar to https://github.com/jradavenport/batlog but for application usage rather than battery usage.

#Install guide
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AshyIsMe/applog
cd applog
./install.sh
```

#Usage
Writes the date, application name and window title to ~/applog.dat in plaintext every second.
Later you can graph this data with whatever tool you like to gain some insight into your computer usage patterns.
